# Getting Started Guide

Analysing neural and behavioral trajectories is tough.
Analysing them through noisy measurements is even tougher.

This is a technical guide to getting started with clinical neural recordings.
Unlike other resources, this is meant to be an engineering guide - our goal is to get things working through whatever means.
Once we get things working, we need to trace back a reasonable causal chain that explains why it all worked out - the reverse engineering stage.
